# KsTU_Group_One 

### Web3 BUIDL ARBITRUM DEVELOPER WORKSHOP `KUMASI TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY GROUP ONE`

#### A Two day `hacker boost`  workshop to onboard newbies to web3 development by teaching them how to build smart contracts , deploying and verifying onchain, and connecting the smart contract to a frontend

#### This repository contains the implementation of a decentralized storage contract along with a frontend interface. Each team member has worked on their respective branches to contribute to the project

#### Each team member's README.md file includes their specific contract deployment address  and transaction hash
